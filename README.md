# chefcurrybot
## Requires: 
  * Node.js w/ version v12.x.x
## Dependencies:
  * discord.js

## How to Run:
  **Important!!**   
  My Discord API key and bot prefix are stored in a local **config.json** file, which is intentionally gitignored from this repo for security.
  $chefcurrybot is configured to use the **$** prefix  
  You need to generate your own Discord API key and add it **config.json** like such:  
  ```
  {   
      "prefix": "$",  
      "token": "Your_Discord_API_Key"     
  } 
  ```
    
  Now, simply just run:  
  **$** node index.js
